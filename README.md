## Run it locally using your own Wolfram | Alpha Keys

In the project directory, you can run:
### `python -m venv c:\path\to\project`
Setups the virtual Environment to start the runtime.

### `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Installs the required the libraries on the local machine. Also install required libraries if not installed use:

> **NOTE:** Python version must be higher than 3.9. The project was developed on 3.11 python version.

### Use your own keys to run the API's

- Update the `index.py` file in the api folder.
- Change the `os.environ.get('WOLFRAM_STEPS_KEY')`, others..., with your own keys for that particular `app_id`.

### `flask --app main run --host 0.0.0.0`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to view it in your browser.

> **NOTE:** These are the API's endpoints that are developed. If you want to test the API's you can either change the config.jsx api Url's with `http://your-ip-address:5000/...` in the frontend of [https://github.com/abhishek-yeole/computegpt/blob/main/src/config.jsx](https://github.com/abhishek-yeole/computegpt/blob/main/src/config.jsx) or use POSTMAN or other services for it.
